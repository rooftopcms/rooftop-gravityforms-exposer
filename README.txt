rooftop-gravityforms-exposer gives access to fields from the excellent Gravityforms plugin,
through the REST API. This is a work in progress.

== Description ==

rooftop-gravityforms-exposer gives access to fields from the Gravityforms plugin, through the Rooftop REST API.

This is a work in progress. In due course there will be a published endpoint to ingest the content of the forms,
so you can post data back into Rooftop CMS

3. There is no step 3 :-)
